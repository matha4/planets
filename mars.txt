We stood by the pond on a winter's day
And the sun was white, as though chidden of God
And some leaves that lay on the starving sod
They had fallen from an ash and were grey.

Your eyes on me were as eyes that rove
Over tedious riddles of years ago
And some words passed between us, to and fro
On which lost the more by our love

And the smile on your lips was the deadest thing
Alive enough to have strength to die
And a grin of bitterness swept thereby
Like an ominous bird a-wing

Since then, keen lessons that love deceives
and wrings with wrongs, have shaped to me
Your face, and a God-cursed sun and a tree
And a pond filled with greying leaves
